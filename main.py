# Expression vs Statement
#Expression: An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.
# Statement: A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.

value = 15; # This is a statement

result = value + 10; # This is a statement (result = value + 10) and this expression (value + 10)
